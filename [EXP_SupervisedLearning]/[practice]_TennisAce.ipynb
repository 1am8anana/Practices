    "You will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, you will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world."

    "No three words are sweeter to hear as a tennis player than those, which indicate that a player has beaten their opponent. While you can head down to your nearest court and aim to overcome your challenger across the net without much practice, a league of professionals spends day and night, month after month practicing to be among the best in the world. Today you will put your linear regression knowledge to the test to better understand what it takes to be an all-star tennis player.\n",

Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes. Load the csv into a DataFrame and investigate it to gain familiarity with the data."
